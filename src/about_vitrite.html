Vitrite is a tiny utility that allows you to adjust the transparency of most visible windows using a combination of hotkeys.<br />
<br />
Just click on the window you wish to modify and press:<br />
[Right Ctrl] + [Right Shift] + [number from numbers row of the keyboard].<br />
<br />
Vitrite can also toggle a window's "always on top" behavior by pressing:<br />
[Right Ctrl] + [Right Shift] + "+" (The plus sign on the numbers row)<br />
<br />
If you want to see how it works then you're in luck.<br />

Have fun,<br />
